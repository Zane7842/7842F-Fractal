 * center of the robot to the center of the wheel the sensor is measuring.
 * The sideways tracker center distance is the vertical distance from the 
 * center of the robot to the center of the sideways wheel being measured.
 * If there's really no sideways wheel we set the center distance to 0 and
 * pretend the wheel never spins, which is equivalent to a no-drift robot.
 * 
 * @param ForwardTracker_center_distance A horizontal distance to the wheel center in inches.
 * @param SidewaysTracker_center_distance A vertical distance to the wheel center in inches.
